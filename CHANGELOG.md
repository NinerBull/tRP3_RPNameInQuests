- Re-enabled all UI customisation options for all clients, with the following caveats for Midnight, due to API restrictions:
  - Your character's RP Name may sometimes not appear in the Unit Frames. For example, when changing TRP3 Profile, your Character's title on the Character Info Window, or when using a transform that changes your character's Name. 
  - No text at all will be modified while in any instance.
